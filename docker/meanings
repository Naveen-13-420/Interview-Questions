36️⃣ How do you optimize Dockerfile layer caching?
Answer:

Docker builds images layer by layer and caches each layer.

To optimize caching:

1. Put frequently changing instructions at the bottom

Example:

COPY . .   ← changes frequently → should be lower

2. Put dependency install steps at the top
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install


Then:

COPY . .


This allows Docker to reuse cached npm install layer.

3. Use .dockerignore

Prevents unnecessary files from breaking cache.

4. Combine RUN instructions
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

5. Avoid ADD . . with large contexts
Interview answer (Short):

Place stable steps at the top and changing steps at the bottom so Docker can reuse cached layers to speed up builds.
