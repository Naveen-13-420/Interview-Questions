Q1: What is cordon and drain?

Cordon marks a node unschedulable (no new pods).
Drain evicts pods safely and reschedules them on other nodes.

❓ Q2: What is surge upgrade?

Surge upgrade temporarily adds extra nodes so that when old nodes are drained and upgraded, there is no capacity shortage.

❓ Q3: Can upgrades cause downtime?

If probes, replicas, and PDBs are not configured properly, yes.
In a well-configured AKS setup, rolling upgrades + probes = zero or minimal downtime.

1️⃣ Why do we not use NodePort in production?

It’s not secure, difficult to manage, and exposes the node directly.

2️⃣ Why do we prefer Ingress over LoadBalancer?

Ingress gives a single entry point with routing, TLS, and WAF support, while LoadBalancer exposes only one service.

3️⃣ Why are private endpoints important in AKS?

They allow AKS pods to communicate privately with Azure services without public exposure, improving security and compliance.

⭐ What exactly does AKS send to Log Analytics?

Tables you must mention in the interview:

✔ ContainerLog

App logs from inside pods

Best for debugging errors/exceptions

✔ KubePodInventory

Pod status

Pod restarts

Pod phase (Running/Pending/CrashLoop)

✔ KubeNodeInventory

Node info

Node pressure (DiskPressure, MemoryPressure)

✔ InsightsMetrics

Node/pod CPU & memory


You MUST mention these KQL queries in interview:
🔹 1. Find pod restarts
KubePodInventory
| where ContainerStatusReason == "CrashLoopBackOff"

🔹 2. Find pod failures
KubePodInventory
| where PodStatus != "Running"

🔹 3. Application logs
ContainerLog
| where PodName contains "api"
| sort by TimeGenerated desc

🔹 4. Node health
KubeNodeInventory
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by Computer

Load Balancer vs Ingress — Interview Answer (Paragraph Form)

In AKS, a LoadBalancer exposes a single Kubernetes service externally by creating an Azure Load Balancer with its own public IP. 
It works at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) and simply forwards traffic to one backend service. The limitation is that if you have multiple services, 
you would need multiple LoadBalancers and multiple public IPs, which increases cost and management overhead.

An Ingress, on the other hand, is a Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) smart router that allows you to expose multiple services using a single public IP. 
It relies on an Ingress Controller such as NGINX or AGIC, and routes traffic based on hostnames or URL paths. With Ingress you can do advanced 
features like TLS termination, path-based routing, host-based routing, rewrites, and WAF integration.

So, the difference is that a LoadBalancer directly exposes one service per IP, while an Ingress exposes many services behind one IP with 
intelligent routing. In production microservices environments, we prefer Ingress because it saves cost, simplifies routing, and provides 
better control over HTTP traffic.


Difference Between kubeadm and kubectl — Interview Answer (Paragraph Format)

kubectl is the command-line tool used to interact with a Kubernetes cluster. It is used for day-to-day operations like creating pods, deployments, 
services, retrieving logs, describing resources, scaling workloads, and managing applications running inside the cluster.

kubeadm, on the other hand, is a cluster bootstrapping tool used to create, configure, and initialize a 
Kubernetes cluster. It helps set up the control plane and worker nodes (kubeadm init, kubeadm join) but is not used for managing workloads.
