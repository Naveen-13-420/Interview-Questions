Q1: What is cordon and drain?

Cordon marks a node unschedulable (no new pods).
Drain evicts pods safely and reschedules them on other nodes.

❓ Q2: What is surge upgrade?

Surge upgrade temporarily adds extra nodes so that when old nodes are drained and upgraded, there is no capacity shortage.

❓ Q3: Can upgrades cause downtime?

If probes, replicas, and PDBs are not configured properly, yes.
In a well-configured AKS setup, rolling upgrades + probes = zero or minimal downtime.
