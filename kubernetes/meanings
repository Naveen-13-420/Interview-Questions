Q1: What is cordon and drain?

Cordon marks a node unschedulable (no new pods).
Drain evicts pods safely and reschedules them on other nodes.

❓ Q2: What is surge upgrade?

Surge upgrade temporarily adds extra nodes so that when old nodes are drained and upgraded, there is no capacity shortage.

❓ Q3: Can upgrades cause downtime?

If probes, replicas, and PDBs are not configured properly, yes.
In a well-configured AKS setup, rolling upgrades + probes = zero or minimal downtime.

1️⃣ Why do we not use NodePort in production?

It’s not secure, difficult to manage, and exposes the node directly.

2️⃣ Why do we prefer Ingress over LoadBalancer?

Ingress gives a single entry point with routing, TLS, and WAF support, while LoadBalancer exposes only one service.

3️⃣ Why are private endpoints important in AKS?

They allow AKS pods to communicate privately with Azure services without public exposure, improving security and compliance.

⭐ What exactly does AKS send to Log Analytics?

Tables you must mention in the interview:

✔ ContainerLog

App logs from inside pods

Best for debugging errors/exceptions

✔ KubePodInventory

Pod status

Pod restarts

Pod phase (Running/Pending/CrashLoop)

✔ KubeNodeInventory

Node info

Node pressure (DiskPressure, MemoryPressure)

✔ InsightsMetrics

Node/pod CPU & memory


You MUST mention these KQL queries in interview:
🔹 1. Find pod restarts
KubePodInventory
| where ContainerStatusReason == "CrashLoopBackOff"

🔹 2. Find pod failures
KubePodInventory
| where PodStatus != "Running"

🔹 3. Application logs
ContainerLog
| where PodName contains "api"
| sort by TimeGenerated desc

🔹 4. Node health
KubeNodeInventory
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by Computer
