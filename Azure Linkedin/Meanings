Q)vWhat is “listening” in networking? Explain with a real-world scenario.
In networking, “listening” means that a server, application, or process is waiting for incoming network connections on a specific IP address + 
port number.When a service is “listening,” it means it has opened a port and is ready to accept requests from clients.Listening means a service has opened a port 
and is waiting for incoming connections. For example, a web server listening on port 80 will accept HTTP requests from clients.

Q) Troubleshooting VNet-to-VNet communication in different regions (Paragraph Format)

When two VNets in different regions cannot communicate, the first thing I do is verify the VNet peering status on both VNets. Peering must show as Connected, 
not “Initiated.” If one side is missing the peering, or if the wrong VNet was selected, communication will fail. Next, I check for overlapping address spaces, 
because VNet peering does not work if both VNets share the same IP range. If necessary, I adjust the address space to avoid conflicts. After that, I review the 
peering configuration settings, ensuring that “Allow VNet-to-VNet traffic” and “Allow forwarded traffic” are enabled, especially if a firewall or NVA sits between 
the VNets.
I then validate NSG rules on both subnets and NICs, because even if peering works, an NSG can block inbound or outbound traffic. I look for rules that deny ports 
like 22, 3389, 1433, or custom application ports. To confirm, I run commands such as:

Test-NetConnection <destination-ip> -Port <port>


or on Linux:

telnet <destination-ip> <port>
curl <destination-ip>:<port>


Next, I check route tables (UDR) attached to the subnets to ensure traffic is not being incorrectly routed to the Internet, a Firewall, or an unreachable NVA. 
I use Effective Routes on the VM NIC to see the actual next-hop logic. If the next hop shows Internet or an unexpected NVA, this indicates a routing issue. 
I also verify that Azure Firewall or any third-party NVA in the path allows the traffic; both inbound and outbound rules must be configured correctly, and 
SNAT behavior may also affect communication.

If applications connect using hostnames rather than IP addresses, I check DNS resolution to ensure that Private DNS Zones or custom DNS servers are resolving 
to the correct private IPs. I test with:

nslookup <hostname>


Finally, if everything at the Azure layer looks correct, I check OS-level firewalls on the VMs — Windows Firewall or Linux iptables/ufw — because these can 
silently block the traffic even when Azure networking allows it. After verifying all layers (Peering → Address Space → NSG → UDR → Firewall → DNS → VM OS Firewall),
I retest connectivity using tools like Test-NetConnection, curl, or ping (ICMP).

Project Architecture Overview (Your Actual Experience Explained Simply)

My current project follows a modern microservices-based architecture hosted entirely on Azure, with a strong focus on AKS, DevOps automation, security, monitoring, and integration services.

🏗 High-Level Architecture
1. Frontend & Global Routing Layer

Azure Front Door (AFD) for global routing, caching, WAF policies, and TLS termination

Routes traffic to backend Azure regions based on:

Latency

Path rules (API vs UI)

Health probes

AFD protects the system from malicious requests using custom WAF rules

2. Application Hosting Layer

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Multiple node pools (system & user)

Ingress Controller (NGINX/AGIC) for routing inside the cluster

HPA for auto-scaling

Pod-level security, readiness/liveness probes

Helm charts for deployments

Azure App Services

Used for specific admin/utility tools

Connected to private endpoints for secure access

3. Data & Storage Layer

Azure SQL Database

For transactional data

Private endpoint + firewall restrictions

Azure Cosmos DB

For semi-structured data and telemetry

Azure Storage Accounts (Blob, Queue, File)

Blob for media & logs

Queues for async processing

Files for legacy data ingestion and log archival

4. Integration & Eventing Layer

Azure Service Bus (Topics & Queues)

Handles async communication between microservices

Dead-letter queues monitored with alerts

Azure Functions

Event-driven background processing

Connected through Service Bus triggers and Event Grid

APIs

6. Monitoring & Observability Layer

Azure Monitor + Log Analytics

Custom KQL alerts for API failures, CPU spikes, Pod memory usage

Application Insights

End-to-end request tracking

Distributed tracing for microservices

Container Insights

Node, pod, and container-level metrics

Azure Alerts → Teams/Email

Threshold-based alerts

Query-based alerts for recurring log patterns (e.g., authentication failures)

7. DevOps Layer

Azure DevOps Repos

Mono-repo or microservice repos

Azure DevOps YAML Pipelines

CI → Build + image push to ACR

CD → Helm-based AKS deployments

Variable groups for secrets

Environment-specific approvals

Terraform

IaC for AKS, SQL, Service Bus, Storage, Networking

Remote backend using Azure Storage + Key for locking

ACR (Azure Container Registry)

Stores container images

Connected to AKS with managed identity

🚀 Summary (Use this in interview to sound confident and structured)

“Our architecture is fully built on Azure using a microservices model. We use Azure Front Door for global routing and WAF, AKS as the primary 
compute layer with Helm-based deployments, and Azure SQL + Cosmos DB for data. We rely heavily on Service Bus for asynchronous communication and 
use Key Vault, private endpoints, NSGs, and Azure Firewall for security. The entire estate is monitored using Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and 
Application Insights. All deployments are automated using Azure DevOps YAML pipelines and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.”
